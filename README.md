## Problem Statement
When the company receives a loan application, it must decide whether to approve the loan based on the applicantâ€™s profile. There are two potential risks associated with this decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, not approving it results in a loss of business for the company.
If the applicant is likely to default on the loan, approving it could lead to a financial loss for the company.

Therefore, the company wants to identify the key factors (or driver variables) that strongly indicate the likelihood of a loan default. Understanding these factors will help the company improve its portfolio management and risk assessment processes.


## Problem Solving Methodology
* Data Understanding-
> Understanding and working with data dictionary and getting good knowledge of all the columns and their domain specific uses.
* Data Cleaning-
> Removing null valued columns, single uniques columns, unnecessary columns then manipulation of data such as conversion of data types, removing outliers, deriving new variables and many more.
* Univariate Analysis-
> Analysing each columns and plotting the distribution of each to get more information.
* Segmented Univariate Analysis-
> To get more insight of single data variables in the form of segments.
* Bivariate Analysis-
> Through this we can analyse two variables and determine empirical relationship between them.

## Conclusions
- Higher the interest rates, higher the chances of default
- Higher the loan amount, higher the chances of default
- Higher the annual income, lower the chances of default
- Higher the grade more is the risk of default.
